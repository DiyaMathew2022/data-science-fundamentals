## Dataset
The dataset used for this work is a the 3-phase oil dataset.This dataset is from a physics-based simulation of a non-invasive monitoring system, used to determine the quantity of oil in a multi-phase pipeline containing a mixture of oil, water, and gas. The whole dataset includes 3 classes, which are homogeneous, annular and laminar (stratified) namely. The configurations of the flow in the pipe are shown in the following figure.

The dataset contains 2 data files train data and test data. Train and test data are named as trndata.csv and tstdata.csv respectively.

The last column of each file is the class label indicating the configuration of the flow in the pipe:
a value of 1 denotes homogeneous, a value of 2 denotes annular, and a value of 3 denotes laminar.
